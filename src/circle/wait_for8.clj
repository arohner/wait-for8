(defn wait-for
  "Higher Order Function that controls retry behavior. By default, call f, and retry (by calling again), if f returns falsey.

 - f - a fn of no arguments.

 Options:

 - sleep: how long to sleep between retries, as a java8 duration. Defaults to 1s.

 - tries: number of times to retry before throwing. An integer,
   or :unlimited. Defaults to 3 (or unlimited if :timeout is given, and :tries is not)

 - timeout: a java8 duration. Stop retrying when period has elapsed,
   regardless of how many tries are left.

 - catch: By default, wait-for does not catch exceptions. Pass this to specify which exceptions should be caught and retried
     Can be one of several things:
     - a seq of exception classes to catch and retry on
     - an fn of one argument, the thrown exception. Retry if it returns truthy.
     - if the exception is a slingshot throwing a map, can be a
       keyword, or a vector of a key and value, destructuring
       slingshot-style. Retry if the value obtained by destrutcturing is truthy

   If the exception matches the catch clause, wait-for
   retries. Otherwise the exception is thrown.

 - success-fn: a fn of one argument, the return value of f. Stop
   retrying if success-fn returns truthy. If not specified, wait-for
   returns when f returns truthy. May pass :no-throw here, which will
   return truthy when f doesn't throw.

 - error-hook: a fn of one argument, an exception. Called every time
   fn throws, before the catch clause decides what to do with the
   exception. This is useful for e.g. logging."
